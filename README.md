# Tableau- Weather Pattern Visualisation

Analysed weather and temporal trends from 1940-2010 and displayed the data as an interactive dashboard for users to customise their required area of interests. 

Users are able to sort through the massive dataset by selecting from the UI located at the top of the screen to navigate through different weather stations and seasons.

From this dashboard we would be able to see the temporal trends from 1960-2010.
