# Tableau- Weather Pattern Visualisation

Analysed weather and temporal trends from 1940-2010 and displayed the data as an interactive dashboard for users to customise their required area of interests. 

Users are able to sort through the massive dataset by selecting from the UI located at the top of the screen to navigate through different weather stations and seasons.

From this dashboard we would be able to see the temporal trends from 1960-2010.
## Dashboard's customizability

## Storyboard - Suggestions on Insurance premium Calculations

Made a short presentation on how i would suggest "ABC insurance" to calculate their premiums for different areas based on weather stations. I used the mean data of temperature, sunshine duration, and precipitation to identify which station would be perfect for crops or which station would be bad for crops. Discounts or increased premiums would be suggested base on these temporal trend.
